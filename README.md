# Tic-Tac-Toe Application

## Project Description

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe application using ReactJS for frontend and Node.js & Express framework for backend. The frontend app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### API Setup

1. Inside the api/ directory, run `npm install` in the command prompt to install the packages and dependencies.
2. Run `node index.js` in the command prompt to run the API server. Make sure that it's listening on port 8000.

### APP Setup

1. Inside the app/ directory, run `npm install` in the command prompt to install the packages and dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` in the command prompt to run the application. Make sure that it's running on localhost:3000.
3. In a browser, type `localhost:3000` in the address bar. Click Start Game to play the game. Make sure that the API is running in background.
